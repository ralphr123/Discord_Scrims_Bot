Every other week, a group of friends and I get together and run Dota 2 matches between ourselves. However, making evenly matched teams was time consuming, and we weren’t keeping track of long term scores. That’s why I decided to create this Discord bot to automate bi-monthly gaming tournament stat-tracking and team splitting. 
It splits groups into two balanced teams for any sort of tournament or scrim, keeping track of long term winrate stats. It also moves teams into respective discord channels for communication, and uses winrates to determine team composition. I used Node.js for the bot and a PostgreSQL database to store win rate stats. 

This mixes some of my two favorite aspects of a project - bringing value to others and implementing a creative solution. The latter was fulfilled by an algorithm that splits a group of ten into two five-person teams of closely matched average win rates. This turned out to be a more challenging problem than expected, and I tried several algorithms and ran randomly generated simulations to test accuracy. I ended up choosing a unique algorithm I created that sorts the array, splits it based on odd and even indexes on first pass, and attempts swaps to improve win rate disparity on second pass.
